# Remove Ammo

A mod for The Long Dark that removes ammo in the world, forcing the player to craft their own. Intended for a more difficult Gunloper, but it works with any custom difficulties.

## Instructions

* Install MelonLoader 
* Put RemoveAmmo.dll into the Mods folder
* Start a new game with a custom difficulty
* Enable one or both of the Remove Ammo options in the gear section

## Additional Notes

* The mod is only active for custom games that started with the Remove Ammo option enabled. All other saves should be unaffected.
* The mod deactivats ammo objects and empties any guns whenever a scene is loaded or when a container is searched for the first time.
* Ammo you place (on the ground, in a gun, or in a container) is safe from being removed, barring some edge cases I haven't found.
* I recommend also trying the CanneryManufacturingDLC mod. It can make guns start out ruined and/or make ammo crafting possible at regular workbenches, or anywhere.

## Disclaimer

* Backup your saves regularly. I did my darnedest to prevent this mod from ever affecting other saves, but if it does, the effects are not reversable.
