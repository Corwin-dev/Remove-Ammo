# Remove Ammo

A mod for The Long Dark that removes (almost) all ammo from the game, forcing the player to craft their own. Intended for a more difficult Rifleloper, but works in any difficulty.

## Instructions

Install MelonLoader and put RemoveAmmo.dll into the Mods folder. There's no settings or anything, just start a new game. I stongly recommend agaisnt loading previous saves.

## Additional Notes

* The mod deactivats ammo objects and empties any guns whenever a scene is loaded or when a container is searched for the first time.
* Ammo you place in the world, in a gun, or in a container is safe from being removed, barring some edge case I haven't found.

## Disclaimer

* The effects are permenant, please be careful with your saves.
* Any area you've visited before installing the mod will still have all the ammo. And any area you revisit after uninstalling the mod will not have any ammo. 
* There's at least one location that still spawns a box of ammo, despite my best efforts to get it removed, and there might be others. Consider it a feature.
